I've done few projects in data analysis using the Microsoft Power-Bi to get the sales insights by cleaning the data, optimizing the DAX functions,
creating column and row level measures, creating field parameter, grouping, data modelling, filtering the visual charts, creating an interactive
dashboard and also to provide a meaningful insights to add value in the growth of the company.
